# Boeing--Business-Case-Analysis
Boeing is a prominent aerospace company known for its high-quality products. The Boeing 737 MAX, part of the fourth generation of the Boeing 737 family, aimed to improve fuel efficiency and extend the range compared to its predecessors.

On October 29, 2018, Lion Air Flight 610, a Boeing 737 MAX 8 en route from Jakarta to Pangkal Pinang, experienced technical issues soon after departing Soekarno-Hatta International Airport. The plane subsequently went into a steep dive and crashed into the Java Sea about 13 minutes after takeoff, prompting an inquiry into IT Governance and Control procedures.

What measures should Boeing implement to enhance safety, rebuild public confidence, and prevent a recurrence of such incidents?
